One of my IoT test systems uses a Browan TBHH100 temperature and humidity sensor in my refrigerator. In April 2025 I started getting some high temperature alerts so I downloaded the log file that I use to log measurements, then looked at the temperature readings over the past 2+ years. 

**20250416_Datacake Outbound Webhook Log - TBHH100 device only.xlsx**: This file contains all the data and the graphs. 
**LG Refrigerator Temperature Performance Analysis.docx**: This file contains screenshots of the graphs to make them easier to print.
