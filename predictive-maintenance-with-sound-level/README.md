A Browan TBSL100 sound level sensor is placed inside the air handler of a residential HVAC system. Data from the sensor goes to the Datacake platform and from there to a Google Sheet. The sensor transmits a message every 5 minutes if there is a sound level between 40-100dBA.

The sensor and air handler are located in Dacula, GA USA. Data is collected from 6/16/2022 - 5/26/2025.

Dates of the last 4 filter change are as follows:
* 3/10/2024
* 5/10/2024
* 2/15/2025
* 5/18/2025

I had hoped to find a correlation between sound level and when the filter is changed - i.e. as the air filter becomes dirtier, the average sound level in the air handler becomes higher, but the data does not seem to support that. For the first 2 filter changes, the average sound level went down after the change, but for the second 2 filter changes, the average sound level went up after the filter changes.
